## The tailwind of Next.js
I first discovered Next.js while browsing the documentation for AWS Amplify. In the hosting section, there is a page outlining intializing and hosting [an Amplify project that uses Next.js](https://docs.amplify.aws/guides/hosting/nextjs/q/platform/js).

## Hosting the code
The code for the site is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/hussrj/static-next-site. It started with the [blog-starter example from Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter).
